        <br>
        <h4> Highlight, a group of five boys, sang the song 'Can Be Better' as a gift to their fans, Light. The album that contains this song was published as an honor of their 8th Anniversary of Debut. This is the number one favorite song of mine because it makes you cheerful and leads you to prevent regretting what you have done in the past.  </h4>

        <br>
        <h4> Clap is a song which is short but exciting. It is sung by 13 boys in a group called Seventeen. The song, 'Clap,' is the title song of Seventeen's Second Official Album, "Teen,Age". I love to listen to this song because it makes you want to dance along with it and turns your mood from tired to hyper. </h4>

        <br>
        <h4> DNA, by BTS, is a song that is both catchy and mesmerizing. The beat of this song is totally different from other K-pop music. I fell in love with this song due to the song turning just a simple tone from a whistle into a music. </h4>

        <br>
        <h4> The song 'Don't Know Men' was first introduced to the world in 2006. Buzz is a boy band which consists with only one vocalist. I didn't know about this song in 2006, but through a TV programm, I got to know the vocalist. I really like the lyrics and the singing technique the singer uses.</h4>
